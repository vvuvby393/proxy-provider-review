# 13 Best Proxy Service Providers in 2025

Web scraping at scale demands reliable proxy infrastructure that won't get you blocked halfway through a data collection project. Whether you're gathering market intelligence, monitoring competitor pricing, or verifying ads across different regions, choosing the right proxy provider determines whether your scraping operation succeeds or burns through bandwidth without results. The difference between premium providers comes down to IP pool quality, rotation mechanisms, geographic coverage, and how well proxies bypass anti-bot systems without triggering captchas every few requests.

## **[Oxylabs](https://oxylabs.io)**

Enterprise-grade proxy network delivering 102+ million residential IPs with advanced rotation controls and unlimited concurrent connections for large-scale data operations.

![Oxylabs Screenshot](image/oxylabs.webp)


Oxylabs operates one of the most extensive residential proxy pools in the industry, providing access to genuine residential IPs across every country worldwide. The network supports both rotating proxies that change with each request and sticky sessions lasting up to 24 hours, giving you flexibility based on whether you need fresh IPs for each request or stable connections for account-based scraping.

The platform uses geographically distributed load balancers that automatically route requests through optimal servers. Customers in China receive dedicated endpoints for better connectivity. You can specify targeting down to city and ZIP code levels, with authentication via credentials or IP whitelisting. SOCKS5 protocol support includes UDP functionality, though this remains in beta.

Integration happens through two methods: Country entry modifies the gateway address based on location and generates different ports for sessions, while Backconnect entry uses one unchanging gateway with parameters appended to the username. The second method enables full functionality including custom session durations and granular filtering, though it requires more complex setup.

Connection requests are effectively unlimited despite traffic-based metering. The service provides both datacenter and ISP proxies alongside residential options, with datacenter proxies offering high speed at lower costs while residential IPs provide better anonymity. Bandwidth optimization techniques and connection pooling help reduce costs when running extended scraping operations.

You can configure networks to only open certain domains, and choose where DNS resolution occurs at the gateway or proxy server level. IPv6-only pool includes roughly 150,000 proxies with fallback mechanisms for websites lacking protocol support.

Connection protocols include HTTP, HTTPS, and SOCKS5 with UDP. Authentication methods cover credentials, IP whitelisting, and API keys. Request caching, domain whitelisting and blacklisting, plus DNS resolution controls provide granular management. Pricing follows pay-as-you-go starting at $15 per GB, with prepaid plans from $500 offering lower per-GB rates.

Rotating residential IPs change for each connection request or after set intervals, reducing the likelihood of being flagged as automated activity. Dedicated datacenter proxies offer constant, stable access used only by single users for secure and reliable web operations. Instant IP changes and auto-rotation options give control over when addresses refresh.

SOCKS5 support handles different traffic types including HTTP, FTP, and SMTP unlike HTTP-only proxies.

SOAX distinguishes itself by exclusively sourcing residential and mobile IPs with full user consent through transparent opt-in models. This ethical approach provides peace of mind that your scraping operations use legitimately obtained IP addresses. The proprietary infrastructure and exclusive ISP agreements create a fully managed, first-party network rather than recycled third-party pools.

Owning and controlling infrastructure enables consistent speeds, better session quality, and unmatched transparency into traffic routing. AI and machine learning optimize proxy usage through smart rotation that automatically selects the most efficient IP based on target domain, request history, and success rate. This removes guesswork and reduces failed requests.

Gateway servers distributed across 195+ countries route requests to proxies automatically. Multiple rotation options include every request, intervals from one to 60 minutes, or custom durations. SOAX lets you bind an IP to a session and keep it for full duration even if the source device goes offline, though sessions expire after 60 seconds of inactivity.

Full SOCKS5 support includes UDP protocol, making SOAX one of few providers offering this capability. Package IDs simplify integration, with location and session parameters appended to usernames while gateway addresses and ports remain constant across HTTP, HTTPS, and SOCKS5 connections.

## **[NetNut](https://netnut.io)**

Direct ISP connection proxy provider delivering one-hop residential proxies with unique architecture routing traffic exclusively through NetNut networks without third-party devices.

![NetNut Screenshot](image/netnut.webp)


NetNut's architecture provides rotating residential proxies with one-hop connectivity, meaning traffic doesn't route through end users' devices. This eliminates bottlenecks in traffic flow. All traffic passes exclusively through NetNut networks without third-party computers, preventing disconnections and interruptions in the proxy network.

The company guarantees service quality by locating all servers on major internet routes or at ISP network connectivity points completely controlled by NetNut. Dedicated account managers provide full integration support including remote sessions when needed. The global proxy network spans hundreds of servers across diverse ISPs.

Residential proxies use real IPs assigned by ISPs to physical locations, appearing as legitimate user traffic rather than datacenter requests. This makes them highly reliable and less likely to face blocks. Static residential proxies offer unlimited-duration sessions with precision country-level targeting, ideal for operations requiring consistent IP addresses.

U.S. city and state-level targeting provides granular location control. Country, city, and ASN filtering helps access regionally restricted content. IP rotation occurs with every request for maximum anonymity, or sticky sessions maintain addresses for specified durations. Billing calculates bandwidth as the sum of data transmitted to and from target sites.

## FAQ

**Which proxy type works best for avoiding blocks during web scraping?**

Residential proxies deliver the best results for avoiding blocks since they use real IP addresses assigned by ISPs to actual devices. Websites see this traffic as coming from legitimate users rather than datacenter servers. For budget-conscious projects, start with rotating residential proxies that change IPs frequently. If you need stable sessions for account-based scraping, choose sticky residential proxies that maintain the same IP for your specified duration.

**How much bandwidth does typical web scraping consume?**

Bandwidth consumption varies dramatically based on target websites and data extraction depth. Scraping simple text-only pages might use 50-200KB per page, while image-heavy e-commerce sites can consume 2-5MB per page. For most projects, expect 100-500GB monthly for moderate scraping operations. Always calculate bandwidth as the sum of request headers, request data, response headers, and response data when estimating costs.

**Can I use one proxy provider for all scraping projects?**

Most enterprise operations benefit from using multiple proxy providers to ensure redundancy and optimize for different use cases. Some providers excel at specific regions or have better success rates with particular websites. However, starting with a single comprehensive provider like [Oxylabs](https://oxylabs.io) works well initially, then expanding to additional services as your needs grow more sophisticated and diverse.

## Conclusion

Selecting the right proxy provider fundamentally impacts web scraping success rates and operational costs. The 13 services covered here each bring distinct advantages, from enterprise-grade features to budget-friendly options perfect for smaller operations. [Oxylabs](https://oxylabs.io) remains the top choice for organizations requiring maximum reliability, extensive IP pools, and unlimited concurrent connections capable of handling large-scale data collection projects without compromise.
